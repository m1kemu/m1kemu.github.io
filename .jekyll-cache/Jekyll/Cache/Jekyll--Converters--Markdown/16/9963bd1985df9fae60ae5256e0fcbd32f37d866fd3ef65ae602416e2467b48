I"V<p>Antivirus (AV) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools have gotten a lot more advanced in recent years. Tricks that I’ve used 2 years ago to get a shell on a typical endpoint just don’t work anymore. Because of this, I’ve had to resort to trying different methods of shellcode execution on hosts. One thing that I’ve noticed is that some common AV/EDR tools fail to detect shellcode injection from Pyinstalled binaries. I don’t have a solid explanation for this, but I do have some theories based on the scarce information available on detection logic for specific AV/EDR.</p>
